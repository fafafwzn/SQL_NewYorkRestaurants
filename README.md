# SQL_WritingBasicQueries
This repo is intended to represent my SQL skill using projects provided by Codecademy.

We have put together a table of restaurants called nomnom and we need your help to answer some questions. Use the SQL commands you just learned and find the best dinner spots in the city.
The schema of this table is as below. ![nomnom](https://github.com/fafafwzn/SQL_NewYorkRestaurants/blob/main/nomnom.png)
